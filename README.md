## Why
There is a massive issue concerning the presence of too many intelligence platforms for Domains, Emails, and IPs
(Identity / Identities). Altas aims to fix this by aggregating and standardizing the
data, to make it easy to understand. The engine seeks to develop a rewarded user-submission system that promotes user reporting and provides reliable first-party data to improve the accuracy of the risk scoring. All data will be subjected to a heuristic algorithm, allowing for both initial and evaluative measures of identity representation.
