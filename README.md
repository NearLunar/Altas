# Altas - Internet Safety Engine

The Risk / Reputation Engine for the Internet. There is a massive issue of too many intelligence platforms for Domains, Emails and IPs (Identity / Identities); Altas aims to fix this by first aggregating and standardizing the data to make it easy to understand. Secondly, develop a rewarded user-submission system that allows users to report; this would promote user reporting and provide first-party data to improve the accuracy of the risk scoring. Finally, a heuristic algorithm will be developed to allow initial and further evaluation of the identity.
